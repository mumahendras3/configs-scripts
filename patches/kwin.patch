# When running under Plasma Full Wayland session, applications launched from
# keyboard shortcuts will not have QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland in their environment,
# making Qt applications like Konsole run in Xwayland mode instead of native
# Wayland mode. This patch will make kwin_wayland not dropping the
# QT_QPA_PLATFORM environment variable unconditionally, rather, resetting it to
# its original value.
